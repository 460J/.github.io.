# # Week 1: Getting started with Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook and Python

# a) Why you chose to join this course â€“ for, motivation, vision, aspiration?
# 
# I chose to join this course because for the past two years I have enjoyed many aspects of what I have learned so far. Each topic is encouraging me to use my creativity and skill to excel in this course, hopefully to find a job in the future that focuses on this field of expertise.

# b) Prior experience, if any, you have with AI and/or Python, and, 
# 
# I have prior knowledge of html but no experience with Python. So I am willing to learn as much as possible.

# c) What you expect to learn from the course (aim for 3-5 bullet points)
# 
# - To have a better understanding of AI, how it can be useful or dangerous.
# - To be able to use Python effectively.
# - To have a conclusive opinion about Ai with my new knowledge.
